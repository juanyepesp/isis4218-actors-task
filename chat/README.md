## Installation and Running the program

To run the project do the following from within the terminal from the directory of the project, in this case, from the "chat" directory:

- iex
- c "chat.exs"
- Chat.start

The messages as seen by each user will appear on the terminal and at the end all the messages that the server processed. You can see that the messages that each user sees correspond to the messages processed by the server from the time they joined to the time they left, as required in the homework. You can see an example of this with the following example:

```
